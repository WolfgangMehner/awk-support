README for awk-support.vim (Version 1.3) / July 24 2016
================================================================================

  *  INSTALLATION
  *  RELEASE NOTES
  *  FILES
  *  ADDITIONAL TIPS
  *  CREDITS

Awk Support implements an Awk-IDE for Vim/gVim. It is written to considerably
speed up writing code in a consistent style. This is done by inserting complete
statements, comments, idioms, and code snippets. Reading the Awk documentation
is integrated. There are many additional hints and options which can improve
speed and comfort when writing Awk. Please read the documentation.

This plug-in can be used with Vim version 7.x.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION
================================================================================

A system-wide installation for all users can also be done. This will have
further effects on how the plug-in works. For a step-by-step instruction, as
well as an explanation of the other consequences, please see the help file
`doc/awksupport.txt` or look up the documentation via:

      :help awksupport-system-wide


(1) LINUX
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The subdirectories in the zip archive `awk-support.zip` mirror the directory
structure which is needed below the local installation directory `$HOME/.vim/`
(find the value of `$HOME` with `:echo $HOME` from inside Vim).

(1.0) Save the template files in `$HOME/.vim/awk-support/templates/Templates`
   if you have changed any of them.

(1.1) Copy the zip archive `awk-support.zip` to `$HOME/.vim` and run

      unzip awk-support.zip

   Afterwards, these files should exist:

      $HOME/.vim/autoload/mmtemplates/...
      $HOME/.vim/doc/...
      $HOME/.vim/plugin/awk-support.vim

(1.2) Loading of plug-in files must be enabled. If not use

      :filetype plugin on

   This is the minimal content of the file `$HOME/.vimrc`. Create one if there
   is none or use the files in `$HOME/.vim/awk-support/rc` as a starting point.

(1.3) Set at least some personal details. Use the map `\ntw` inside a Awk buffer
   or the menu entry:

      Awk -> Snippets -> template setup wizard

   It will help you set up the file _runtimepath_/templates/personal.templates .
   The file is read by all plug-ins supporting this feature to get your personal
   details. Here is the minimal personalization (my settings as an example):

      SetMacro( 'AUTHOR',      'Wolfgang Mehner' )
      SetMacro( 'AUTHORREF',   'wm' )
      SetMacro( 'EMAIL',       'wolfgang-mehner@web.de' )
      SetMacro( 'COPYRIGHT',   'Copyright (c) |YEAR|, |AUTHOR|' )

   Use the file `$HOME/.vim/templates/awk.templates` to customize or add to your
   Awk template library. It can also be set up via the wizard.

   (Read more about the template system in the plug-in documentation.)

(1.4) Make the plug-in help accessible by typing the following command on the
   Vim command line:

      :helptags $HOME/.vim/doc/

(1.5) Consider additional settings in the file `$HOME/.vimrc`. The files
   `customization.vimrc` and `customization.gvimrc` are replacements or extensions
   for your `.vimrc` and `.gvimrc`. You may want to use parts of them. The files
   are documented.


(2) WINDOWS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The subdirectories in the zip archive `awk-support.zip` mirror the directory
structure which is needed below the local installation directory
`$HOME/vimfiles/` (find the value of $HOME with `:echo $HOME` from inside Vim).

(2.0) Save the template files in `$HOME/vimfiles/awk-support/templates/Templates`
   if you have changed any of them.

(2.1) Copy the zip archive awk-support.zip to `$HOME/vimfiles` and run

      unzip awk-support.zip

   Afterwards, these files should exist:

      $HOME/vimfiles/autoload/mmtemplates/...
      $HOME/vimfiles/doc/...
      $HOME/vimfiles/plugin/awk-support.vim

(2.2) Loading of plug-in files must be enabled. If not use

      :filetype plugin on

   This is the minimal content of the file `$HOME/_vimrc`. Create one if there
   is none or use the files in `$HOME/vimfiles/awk-support/rc` as a starting point.

(2.3) Set at least some personal details. Use the map `\ntw` inside a Awk buffer
   or the menu entry:

      Awk -> Snippets -> template setup wizard

   It will help you set up the file _runtimepath_/templates/personal.templates .
   The file is read by all plug-ins supporting this feature to get your personal
   details. Here is the minimal personalization (my settings as an example):

      SetMacro( 'AUTHOR',      'Wolfgang Mehner' )
      SetMacro( 'AUTHORREF',   'wm' )
      SetMacro( 'EMAIL',       'wolfgang-mehner@web.de' )
      SetMacro( 'COPYRIGHT',   'Copyright (c) |YEAR|, |AUTHOR|' )

   Use the file `$HOME/vimfiles/templates/awk.templates` to customize or add to
   your Awk template library. It can also be set up via the wizard.

   (Read more about the template system in the plug-in documentation.)

(2.4) Make the plug-in help accessible by typing the following command on the
   Vim command line:

      :helptags $HOME\vimfiles\doc\

(2.5) Consider additional settings in the file `$HOME/_vimrc`. The files
   `customization.vimrc` and `customization.gvimrc` are replacements or extensions
   for your `_vimrc` and `_gvimrc`. You may want to use parts of them. The files
   are documented.


(3) ADDITIONAL REMARKS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a lot of features and options which can be used and influenced:

  *  use of template files and macros
  *  using and managing personal code snippets
  *  using additional plug-ins

Look at the Awk Support help with:

      :help awksupport

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADDITIONAL TIPS
================================================================================

(1) gvim. Toggle 'insert mode' <--> 'normal mode' with the right mouse button
   (see mapping in file `customization.gvimrc`).

(2) gvim. Use tear off menus and

(3) try 'Focus under mouse' as window behavior (No mouse click when the mouse
   pointer is back from the menu entry).

(4) Use Emulate3Buttons "on" (X11) even for a 3-button mouse. Pressing left and
   right button simultaneously without moving your fingers is faster then moving
   a finger to the middle button (often a wheel).
